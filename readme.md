ChatMate is a helper tool for livestreamers and viewers. It consists of three main parts:
- Server (`./projects/server`): Node.js express app that runs the core logic for ChatMate and directly interacts with YouTube (via the [Youtube API](https://developers.google.com/youtube/v3/live/docs) and [Masterchat](https://github.com/sigvt/masterchat/)), Twitch (via [Twurple](https://github.com/twurple/twurple)), and the MySQL database (via [Prisma](https://github.com/prisma/prisma)). Exposes a collection of REST API endpoints.
- Studio (`./projects/studio`): [React](https://github.com/facebook/react) web interface for managing streamer and viewer data. It communicates with the server API endpoints.
- Client ([`chat-mate-client`](https://github.com/RebelGuy/chat-mate-client)): Minecraft 1.8.9 mod for viewing and managing livestreams and viewers. Contains additional streamer tools that do not communicate with the server.

Other projects in this repo:
- Masterchat (`./projects/masterchat`): A fork of [Masterchat](https://github.com/sigvt/masterchat/) (apparently discontinued) which allows access to YouTube livestream data without using the API. The forked version has some tweaks and fixes to make it a better fit for ChatMate.
- API Models (`./projects/api-models`): Contains the schema definition of each of the Server's API endpoints. Further, it defines all Public Objects, which are serialisable data objects used by the API endpoints.
- Shared (`./projects/shared`): General code that is used by both the Server and Studio projects.

For more info about each project, refer to the project's Readme file.

Streamers are encouraged to peruse the [Streamer Guide](./docs/streamer-guide.md) for more info on how to use ChatMate.

## Running ChatMate locally
To get things running, ensure Node 18 is installed* (recommend [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm)), and a global version of `yarn` exists (`npm install --global yarn`). If `yarn --version` fails on Windows, run PowerShell as an administrator and execute the command `Set-ExecutionPolicy Unrestricted`. New packages should be added either using `yarn add <packageName> [--dev]` in their respective workspace or, to avoid changing the formatting in the `package.json`'s scripts, manually added to the `dependencies` object.

*If updating the Node version, please make sure to also update the Azure environment and CI build scripts.

Ensure the VSCode Typescript version is the same as the one used in the workspace to avoid getting "Type instantiation is excessively deep and possibly infinite" errors all over the place.

Recommended VSCode extensions:
- `ESLint`
- `GitLens` and `Git Graph`
- `DotENV`
- `Prisma` (only useful if you intend to make changes to the database schema)
- `GitHub Actions` (only useful if you intend to make changes to the CI build process)

## CI and deployment
Github Actions are used for automatically building and deploying the Server/Studio projects when pushed.

Pushing to any branch will trigger the build process. Pushing to `master` (production) or `develop` (sandbox) will also trigger automatic deployment to the respective environment, unless the string `--skip-deploy` is contained in the commit message.

By default, the deployment of the Server includes an automatic migration of the database. If the string `--skip-migrations` is included in the commit message, new migrations will not be applied (for both the server build and test runs). Note that migrations in the server build are already skipped if `--skip-deploy` is included in the commit message.

If the string `--skip-tests` is included in the commit message, test files will not be built and unit tests will be skipped.

If the string `--skip-server` is included in the commit message, the Server project will not be built, tested, or deployed. Note that migrations will still run.

If the string `--skip-studio` is included in the commit message, the Studio project will not be built, tested, or deployed.

When deploying the server that includes database migrations, ensure you stop the server before the migration, and after the server deployment has succeeded. Failure to do so causes undefined behaviour with potentially corrupt data being persisted to the database.

## ChatMate admin channels
External ChatMate channels are used to join streamers' chat rooms, listen for data, and perform moderation actions. They are linked to the registered user with username `chatmate`. ChatMate assumes that this registered user exists in the database.

For more info about the OAuth applications, refer to the docs for [Youtube](./docs/youtube-auth.md)/[Twitch](./docs/twitch-auth.md).

*YouTube appears to be prohibiting the word "mate" in the channel name.

## Common Problems And How To Fix Them

### Streamer
Problem: 401 (Unauthorised) error from Twitch when a streamer attempts to initiate a moderation request, such as banning a user. The error message reads something like "The ID in moderator_id must match the user ID found in the requestâ€™s OAuth token".
Solution: Most likely the user has authorised ChatMate using the wrong Twitch account. They should refresh their authorisation via the Studio stream manager using the correct account.

Problem: Streamlabs donations are not being received by ChatMate.
Solution: If the streamer has set a socket access token and is still unable to receive donation events, it is likely that the access token has changed. Getting the new token and setting it on the /manager page should fix the problem.

## v1.29 - The Publication Update [6/1/2024]
- Server
  - Livestreams are no longer coupled exclusively to Youtube. That is, it is possible to start a livestream on either Youtube or Twitch
    - ChatMate listens to Twitch online/offline events to be notified when a streamer goes live. This means streaming exclusively on Twitch requires no per-stream setup
    - ChatMate internal livestream objects are now derived from individual Youtube and Twitch streams, which takes into account overlap between those streams
    - If a livestream object can be continued if the duration between the previous stream's end time and the new stream's start time is less than 5 minutes
  - Similar to punishments, ChatMate now listens to modding/unmodding events on Youtube/Twitch, and attempts to sync the internal rank and propagates the action to the user's other connected channels

  - ChatMate now tracks external API requests for debugging and reporting purposes
- Studio
  - If a logged-out user visits a page requiring them to be logged in, they will now be sent automatically to the login page and, upon logging in, back to the original page

  - Cleaned up the Stream Manager page to show less errors and only sections relevant to the streamer's streaming platforms

## v1.28 - The Youtube Update [20/11/2023]
- Server
  - ChatMate now listens to punishment updates on Twitch and Youtube
    - If a user is puished externally, ChatMate will trigger a sync which propagates the rank update internally, and externally to any other connected channels
    - Youtube does not provide a proper API for this, and the Youtube implementation is crude and unreliable, but technically functional in the majority of cases
  - ChatMate now listens to deleted messages
    - Deleted messages are no longer accessible via the ChatMate API
  - Added ChatMate as a Google OAuth application
    - Streamers can authorise ChatMate to access the API on their behalf  
  - ChatMate now performs rank-related actions on Youtube via the official API instead of Masterchat
    - The default API quota is extremely limited
    - Timeouts can now be an arbitrary duration between 1 second and 1 day, instead of the previous static 5 minutes

    - Commands do not count towards experience
  - Ability for users to link channels to their registered ChatMate account
    - Users generate a link token on Studio which primes the link between their account and the selected channel
    - To execute the link, the channel that is to be linked must send the command `!link <link token>`
    - When linking multiple channels, all experience, ranks, and donations are merged
    - Only admins can undo links, if required
  - Overhaul of the internal handling of different user types and consistent annotations/variable names to un-ambiguously indicate intent
    - Default Users: The Chat Users that are directly attached to YouTube or Twitch channels. They may be linked to zero or one Aggregate User.
    - Aggregate Users: The Chat Users that are directly attached to Registered Users. There is a one-to-one relationship between Aggregate and Registered Users, and a one-to-many relationship to Default Users.
    - Primary Users: Refers to the single Aggregate User if the user is linked to one, or the single Default User otherwise.
    - Experience, ranks, and donations, are consistently linked to Primary Users. This means that no match would be returned for getting a Default User's rank if that user has been linked to an Aggregate User.
- Studio
  - Added Link page
    - Users can create new tokens, view their currently linked channels, and view their link history
    - Admins can manually link users or remove existing links, as well as view other users' linked channels and histories

- Server
  - Added the ability to register as a user, and for registered users to authenticate themselves. Registered Users may be linked to Chat Users 
  - Added the concept of Streamers. Almost all data is now isolated within the context of a Streamer, such as experience, custom emojis, donations, and ranks
  - Added streamlined guards to API endpoints. Some endpoints now require one or more of the following:
    - A loginToken header
    - A Streamer name header
    - The logged-in user to have a certain rank (in the context of the Streamer or, if no Streamer context exists, globally)
- Studio
  - Added a registration form to become a Streamer, and a way for admins to approve/rejects applications
  - Added the ability to log in/out
