Stores are classes that abstract away direct interactions with the database via Prisma to segragate the testing of business logic and data access. The test suites must be defined in `stores.tests.ts` instead of their individual files to guarantee that tests are run in series.

The number of concurrent queries that the database allows is limited, and There is some latency when communicating between the server and database (on the order of 10-20 ms, it seems). Preferrably, Prisma queries should return collections of results instead of individual results, so that aggregation of data is done directly on the database to reduce the number of queries and improve performance. For example, instead of getting experience for only a specific user, get experience for all users (or optionally a subset of specific users) in a single query. Due to limitations with the Prisma ORM capabilities, this may require the use of raw SQL queries.
