# Prisma Cheat Sheet

For new projects: https://www.prisma.io/docs/getting-started/setup-prisma/start-from-scratch/relational-databases-typescript-mysql

## Commands
- `prisma db push` is useful for prototyping database changes without creating any migrations (i.e. "play around"). See https://www.prisma.io/docs/concepts/components/prisma-migrate/db-push

- `prisma db pull`: "introspect" a database, that is, create a Prisma Schema File from the database. Note: any formatting/comments will be overwritten.

- `prisma migrate resolve --applied "20201127134938_my_migration"`: marks the provided migration as "applied", e.g. if the SQL instructions were manually run

- logging queries for performance debugging: https://www.prisma.io/docs/concepts/components/prisma-client/working-with-prismaclient/logging#event-based-logging


## Schema
https://www.prisma.io/docs/concepts/components/prisma-schema/data-model
- can create and use `enum`s in the `schema.prisma` file

## Querying
Create a type that only `select`s certain columns of a table:
```typescript
const userPersonalData = Prisma.validator<Prisma.UserArgs>()({
  select: { email: true, name: true },
})
type UserPersonalData = Prisma.UserGetPayload<typeof userPersonalData>
```

`include` relations of a model:
```typescript
async function getUsersWithPosts() {
  const users = await prisma.user.findMany({ include: { posts: true } })
  return users
}
```

Using nested queries to create objects is recommended as they operate on an all-or-none basis.
See https://www.prisma.io/docs/concepts/components/prisma-client/relation-queries for examples.


## Migration problems and resolutions

### Index and Foreign Key mapping
Prisma automatically takes care of indexing columns that are foreign keys, as well as creating the foreign keys themselves. Unfortunately, this breaks when columns or tables are renamed, and so we have to manage the names (mappings) ourselves. Use the following conventions to define custom mappings:

- **Unique columns:** `@@unique([..., map: "<mappedTableName>_<columnName>_key")`. Don't use the `@unique()` tag next to the column definition.
- **Foreign key indexes:** `@@index(..., map: "<mappedTableName>_<idColumnName>_fkey")`
- **Foreign relations:** `@relation(..., map: "<mappedTableName>_<idColumnName>_fkey")`

Following these conventions at all times will make it easier to refactor later on, especially renaming things.

### Validation error

If, after a migration, the following error is encountered:

```
Failed to validate the query: `Field does not exist on enclosing type.`
```

then simply run `yarn workspace server generate` and the problem should go away.
