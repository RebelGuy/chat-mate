The server is responsible for fetching data from Youtube via the `masterchat` project, and from Twitch via the `@twurple` package. It exposes this chat data, as well as additional functionality, via a REST API.



# Project Details
Built JavaScript files live in the `./dist` folder, while generated data (e.g. logs) live in the `./data` folder.

Note: If fetching Youtube metadata incurs a "Rate limit exceeded" error, then Youtube has flagged us as a bot. A (temporary?) solution is to regenerate an auth token (see below).

Twitch's EventSub notifies us of new events via a webhook. To set up the listener on our local machine, we use `ngrok` (https://ngrok.com/download). See https://twurple.js.org/docs/getting-data/eventsub/listener-setup.html for more details. If you get an `EACCESS` error on Linux when the local server is starting up, right click the `/dist/bin/ngrok` file and, in the Permissions tab, ensure you are allowing the file to be executed as a program.

An SSL certificate for use by the Twitch EventSub can be generated by opening a git terminal and running the command `openssl req -newkey rsa:2048 -nodes -keyout key.pem -x509 -days 365 -out certificate.pem`.

Note: Importing modules from Twurple must be done from the package level, `@twurple/<package-name>`, rather than `@twurple/<package-name>/lib` (unfortunately VSCode defaults to this type of importing, which will result in a runtime error). 


## Scripts for development:
1. `yarn install`.
2. `yarn auth:youtube:<local|debug|release>` to refresh the authentication credentials
3. `yarn watch` while developing
  - This uses `swc` to bundle up the Javascript, which skips type checking for performance (about 4 times faster)
  - Rely on VSCode for checking types if using this mode
  - Use `yarn watch:check` to use `ts-loader` and enable type checking
4. `yarn start:local` to run the server locally, or `yarn start:mock` to use fake implementations of controllers, where available.

If building fails because the Prisma client could not be found, please run `yarn generate`.


## Authentication
### YouTube
Run `yarn auth:youtube:<local|debug|release>` and log in using the streaming account, or a moderator account. The access token will automatically be stored in the database (`youtube_auth` table) against the channel ID.

### Twitch
Enure you create an application on the [Twitch Developer Console](https://dev.twitch.tv/console/apps). Note down the application ID and secret and set the relevant environment variables. These will not change in the future. There should be a separate application for the `release`, `debug`, and `local` environments [note: at the moment, `debug` and `local` share the same application].

For the initial authentication, you will need to start the Electron app via `yarn auth:twitch:<local|debug|release>` and sign in manually with the relevant ChatMate account. The access token and refresh token will automatically be stored in the database (`twitch_auth` table) and retrieved/updated automatically thereon.

Important: The application scope is hardcoded in `TwurpleAuthProvider.ts` at the moment. Making any changes to the scope will require that you repeat the authentication process described above.

At the moment, the Twitch auth script is broken because Twitch rejects Electron as a valid browser. An alternative way of refreshing the Twitch Application authentication is via the `/admin/twitch` page on Studio.

## Logging

When deployed, we use Application Insights to track all error and warning messages via the Trace event.

At all times, we are logging all messages to the file system. On Azure, the data folder lives under `/site/data` and can be accessed via FileZilla.

# .env
Define `local.env`, `debug.env` and `release.env` files that set the following environment variables, one per line, in the format `KEY=value`. The `template.env` file can be used as a template. **On Azure, these variables must be set manually in the app service's configuration.**

The following environment variables must be set in the `.env` file:
- `PORT`: Which port the server should run on.
- `STUDIO_URL`: The URL to ChatMate Studio (not ending in `/`).
- `CHANNEL_ID`: The channel ID of the user on behalf of which ChatMate will communicate with YouTube.
- `TWITCH_CLIENT_ID`: The client ID for twitch auth (from https://dev.twitch.tv/console/apps).
- `TWITCH_CLIENT_SECRET`: The client secret for twitch auth.
- `TWITCH_USERNAME`: The channel name of the ChatMate Twitch account. This will be used to connect to streamers' chat rooms and perform moderation operations.
- `STREAMLABS_ACCESS_TOKEN`: The access token for the Streamlabs account associated with the broadcaster's account. It can be found at https://streamlabs.com/dashboard#/settings/api-settings
- `DATABASE_URL`: The connection string to the MySQL database that Prisma should use. **Please ensure you append `?pool_timeout=30&connect_timeout=30` to the connection string (after the database name)** to prevent timeouts during busy times. More options can be found at https://www.prisma.io/docs/concepts/database-connectors/mysql
  - The local database connection string for the debug database is `mysql://root:root@localhost:3306/chat_mate_debug?connection_limit=5&pool_timeout=30&connect_timeout=30`
  - The remote database connection string for the debug database is `mysql://chatmateadmin:{{password}}@chat-mate.mysql.database.azure.com:3306/chat_mate_debug?connection_limit=5&pool_timeout=30&connect_timeout=30`
- `ENABLE_DB_LOGGING`: [Optional, defaults to `false`] Whether to include database-related actions in the logs. Note that, even if this is `false`, any warning and errors will still be included.
- `DB_SEMAPHORE_CONCURRENT`: [Optional, defaults to `1000`] How many concurrent database requests to allow, before queuing any new requests. Note that operations on the Prisma Client generate many direct database requests, so this number shouldn't be too low (> 50).
- `DB_SEMAPHORE_TIMEOUT`: [Optional, defaults to `null`] The maximum number of milliseconds that a database request can be queued before timing it out. If null, does not timeout requests in the queue.
- `DB_TRANSACTION_TIMEOUT`: [Optional, defaults to `5000`] The maximum number of milliseconds a Prisma transaction can run before being cancelled and rolled back.

The following set of environment variables is available only for **local development** (that is, where `NODE_ENV`=`local`):
- `USE_FAKE_CONTROLLERS`: [Optional, defaults to `fa
lse`] If true, replaces some controllers with test-only implementations that generate fake data. This also disables communication with external APIs (that is, it is run entirely offline).

The following set of environmnet variables is available only for **deployed instances** (that is, where `NODE_ENV`=`debug` || `NODE_ENV`=`release`):
- `APPLICATIONINSIGHTS_CONNECTION_STRING`: The connection string to use for connecting to the Azure Application Insights service. *This is set automatically by Azure.*
- `HOST_NAME`: The host name at which the deployed server is reachable, e.g. `example.com`. *This is set automatically by Azure.*

In addition, the following environment variables must be injected into the node instance using the `cross-env` package:
- `NODE_ENV`: Either `local`, `debug` or `release` to indicate which servers we are connecting to. Some behaviour is different when running the server locally than when the server is deployed.

Finally, the following environment variables must be present in the `<local|debug|release>.env` file when building via webpack. These are not checked at runtime, and ommitting them leads to undefined behaviour. *Note: if you change these, you need to update the `build-and-deploy.yml` file and ensure the new variables are inserted into the `.env` file.*
- `NAME`: A unique name to give this build.

For testing, define a `test.env` file that sets only a subset of the above variables:
- `DATABASE_URL`

## Database

The `local` and `debug` MySQL database is named `chat_mate_debug`, while the `release` database is named `chat_mate`, and the `test` databases are named `chat_mate_test` and `chat_mate_test_debug`. Ensure the `DATABASE_URL` connection string is set in the respective [`.env`](#.env) file.

`Prisma` is used as both the ORM and typesafe interface to manage communications with the underlying MySQL database. Run `yarn migrate:debug` to sync the local DB with the checked-out migrations and generate an up-to-date Prisma Client.

At any point where the prisma file (`prisma.schema` - the database schema) is modified, `yarn generate` can be run to immediately regenerate the Prisma Client for up-to-date typings. This should also be run if the project structure changes in some way. No actual database changes are performed as part of this command. For more help and examples with using the Prisma Client and querying, see https://www.prisma.io/docs/concepts/components/prisma-client.


### Migrations
Run `yarn migrate:schema` to generate a new `migration.sql` file for updating the MySQL database, which will automatically be opened for editing. Note that while this migration is not applied, any earlier unapplied migrations will be executed prior to generating the new migration. All outstanding migrations can be applied explicitly, and a new Prisma Client generated, using `yarn migrate:apply`.

During a migration, ensure that the `.sql` is checked and edited to avoid data loss, but avoid making manual changes that affect the database schema, other than the ones already present.

Migrations are autoamtically run in CI during the deployment process. This occurs during the last step before deployment, but it is still possible that something goes wrong where the migration succeeds, but deployment fails. For this reason, migrations should follow an expand and contract pattern.

## Punishments
Punishments are used to temporarily or permanently hide users' livestream messages. Any punishment can be revoked at any time. Punishment reasons and revoke reasons are supported but optional. Punishments can be either temporary or permanent, depending on the type.

Currently there are 3 punishment types:
1. `mute`: This is an internal punishment, and is used by the client to hide messages of a certain user. A mute can be temporary or permanent.
2. `timeout`: This is both internal and external (i.e. sent to YouTube and Twitch) and completely stops the user from sending messages in the livestream chat. It is always temporary. Due to limitations with the Masterchat implementation, timeouts must be at least 5 minutes long. Furthermore, we have a service that refreshes YouTube timeouts periodically if they are longer than 5 minutes.
3. `ban`: This is essentially a permanent timeout.

## Testing
`yarn test` performs the test suite.
`yarn test:db` Sets up the test database.
`yarn test <file regex>` includes only tests within files matching the expression.

Further, to filter individual tests, temporarily replace `test()` with `test.only()`. All `test()`s will then be skipped.

Due to concurrency issues, all tests using the test database will need to be run from the central `_test/stores.test.ts` file. It imports the `<StoreName>.suite.ts` files which contain the actual test, then run them one-by-one.

# API Endpoints

Use the API endpoints to communicate with the server while it is running. The API base URL is `http://localhost:3010/api`.

A response contains the following properties:
- `timestamp` (`number`): The unix timestamp (in ms) at which the response was generated.
- `success` (`boolean`): True if the request was processed correctly, and false otherwise.
- `data` (`object`): Only included if `success` is `true`. Contains the response data, outlined for each endpoint below.
- `error` (`object`): Only included if `success` is `false`. Contains the following properties:
  - `errorCode` (`number`): The HTTP error code that most closely matches the type of problem encountered.
  - `errorType` (`string`): The general type of error encounterd.
  - `message` (`string`): An optional error message describing what went wrong.

Note that a `500` error can be expected for all endpoints, but any other errors should be documented specifically in the below sections.

All non-primitive properties of `data` are of type `PublicObject`, which are reusable objects which themselves contain either primitive types or other `PublicObject`s. The definitions for these objects can be found in the `./controllers/public` folder and will not be reproduced here. Please ensure the client's model is in sync at all times.

Authentication is required for most endpoints. To authenticate a request, provide the login token returned by the `/account/register` or `/account/login` endpoints, and add it to requests via the `X-Login-Token` header.
